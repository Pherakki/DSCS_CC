# DSCS_CC

Costume Creator for Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth.

## Build Instructions
In the main repository directory, run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`. This will compile the dependency `DSCSRenderer` and move the library to the main repository directory.
Instructions to compile the project itself to an executable will come later.
